@node installation "Installation"

@{b}Installation@{ub}

Follow the steps for successful installation:

@{" "}

- For AmigaOS 3 & 4, Install AmiSSL and a TCP/IP stack if not already done so
- Download and install MUI. Version 5 recommended, version 3 minimum. Reboot.
- Download and install codesets.library, render.library, MCC_Guigfx, MCC_NList and MCC_TextEditor
- Download the latest release of AmigaGPT
- Extract the `amigagpt.lha` archive to a temporary location.
- Run the provided installer.

@{b}Optional steps to enable speech functionality@{ub}

AmigaGPT supports reading the output aloud. How AmigaGPT does this depends on whether you are using AmigaOS 3 or 4. Or for OpenAI voices, this works on every system.

@{b}AmigaOS 3@{ub}

Native speech on AmigaOS 3 requires a file called `narrator.device` which cannot be included with AmigaGPT because it is still under copyright. Therefore, you must copy this file legally from your Workbench disks so that AmigaGPT will be able to synthesise speech. There are 2 versions of `narrator.device` supported, v34 and v37. 

v34 is the original version that came with Workbench 1.x.

v37 was an updated version included with Workbench 2.0.x. It has more features and sounds more natural, however it does sound quite different which is why AmigaGPT supports you installing both versions and your choice of version to be used can be selected in the Speech menu in the app.

Regardless of which version of 'narrator.device' you choose to install (or both), AmigaGPT requires that you install the free third party `translator.library; v43. This works with both versions of 'narrator.device'.

OpenAI's 16 bit speech is done with AHI.

@{"Installing `translator.library` v43 " link tran43}
@{"Installing `narrator.device` v34" link narrator34}
@{"Installing `narrator.device` v37" link narrator37}
@{"Installing AHI " link ahi}

@{b}AmigaOS 4@{ub}

Native speech on AmigaOS 4 is done with the help of Flite Device.

OpenAI's 16 bit speech is done with AHI.

@{"Installing flite.device " link flite}
@{"Installing AHI " link ahi}

@endnode

@node tran43 "Installing translator.library v43"

@{b}Installing `translator.library` v43@{ub}

Since `translator.library` v43 is not available as a standalone install, you will need to install v42 and then patch it to v43.

- Download http://aminet.net/util/libs/translator42.lha and extract the archive to any convenient location on your Amiga such as `RAM:`
- Navigate to that directory and double click the `Install` program
- Run the installer using all the default settings
- Download http://aminet.net/util/libs/Tran43pch.lha and once again extract it to a location of your choice
- Navigate to that directory and double click the `Install` program
- Run the installer using all the default settings
- Reboot your Amiga - It will not work until the system is restarted

@endnode

@node narrator34 "Installing `narrator.device` v34"

@{b}Installing `narrator.device` v34@{ub}

Insert your Workbench 1.x disk and copy `df0:devs/narrator.device` to `{AmigaGPTProgramDirectory}/devs/speech/34`

@endnode

@node narrator37 "Installing `narrator.device` v37"

@{b}Installing `narrator.device` v37@{ub}

Insert your Workbench 2.0.x (you cannot use 2.1 because the speech libraries were removed after version 2.0.4) disk and copy `df0:devs/narrator.device` to `{AmigaGPTProgramDirectory}/devs/speech/37`

@endnode

@node ahi "Installing `AHI` for OpenAI voices

@{b}Installing AHI@{ub}

If your OS doesn't come with AHI, you can download it from http://aminet.net/package/driver/audio/ahiusr_4.18

@endnode

@node flite "Installing flite.device"

- Download Flite Device from http://aminet.net/package/mus/misc/flite_device
- Extract the archive and run the installer

@endnode

@node launching "Launching AmigaGPT"
@{b}Launching AmigaGPT@{ub}

- Launch the application by double-clicking the AmigaGPT icon
- You may also launch the app in the command line but before you do, run the command `STACK 20000` to give the program 20kb of stack since the default stack size for apps launched from the shell is 4kb and this is not enough for AmigaGPT and will cause random crashes due to stack overflow. This is not required when you launch the app by double clicking the icon since the stack size is saved in the icon.

@endnode

@node screen "Screen select"
@{b}Selecting a screen to open AmigaGPT in@{ub}

AmigaGPT can run on its own screen or in Workbench. To configure this, open the MUI Settings menu item from the View menu and configure it in the "Screen" or "System" menu in the MUI Setings panel.

If you open in a new screen you have the ability to create a screen for the app to open in. AmigaGPT supports anything from 320x200 all the way up to 4k resolution if using a video card for RTG. Bear in mind text will appear very tiny in resolutions above 1080p so you may want to increase the font size settings from the MUI settings in the View menu when the app opens.

@endnode

@node apikey "Entering your OpenAI API key"
@{b}Entering your OpenAI API key@{ub}

When launching for the first time you will need to enter your OpenAI API key before you can start chatting. If you haven't already done so, create an OpenAI account and navigate to https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys to generate an API key for use with AmigaGPT.

@endnode

@node chatting "Chatting with ChatGPT"
@{b}Chatting with ChatGPT@{ub}

When the app has opened, you are presented with a text input box. You can type any prompt into this box and press "Send" or Shift + Enter to see ChatGPT's response. The generated text appears in the box above the input. Depending on if you have speech configured and enabled, you will also hear it spoken to you.

You can choose to have this text read aloud using the "Speech" menu option. You can also select which model for OpenAI to use in the "OpenAI" menu option.

@endnode

@node conlist "Conversation list"
@{b}Conversation list@{ub}

To the left of the chat box is a conversation list which you can use to go to another saved conversation. New conversations can be created with the "New chat" button and conversations can be removed with the "Delete chat" button. Your conversations will get saved and they will appear again the next time you open AmigaGPT.

@endnode

@node images "Generating images"
@{b}Generating Images@{ub}

To generate images, simply select your desired image generation model from the "OpenAI" menu then type your prompt in the text box then hit the "Create Image" button. When it has been downloaded to your Amiga, you are then able to open the image to your desired scale, or save a copy of the file to a new location on your Amiga. Do note however that AmigaGPT will automatially save all your generated images until you delete them. This is just in case you would like to create a copy elsewhere.

@endnode

@node editmenu "Edit menu"
@{b}Edit menu@{ub}

In the "Edit" menu, you'll find basic text editing commands like Cut, Copy, Paste and Clear.

@endnode

@node appearance "Changing the appearance of AmigaGPT"
@{b}Changing the appearance of AmigaGPT@{ub}

You may change the appearance of the app including the fonts and colours.

To change your settings, go to the "MUI Settings" in the "View" menu.

@endnode

@node proxy "Using a proxy server"
@{b}Using a proxy server@{ub}

The "Connection" menu allows you to connect via a proxy server. It supports both HTTP and HTTPS proxy servers but if you use an unecrypted HTTP proxy server you can improve the performance of AmigaGPT by removing the need for the encryption of the OpenAI traffic to be done on the system running AmigaGPT. For an easy proxy server you can run on your local network you can try out https://mitmproxy.org

@endnode

@node arexx "ARexx integration"
@{b}ARexx integration@{ub}

AmigaGPT includes ARexx support, allowing you to control the application programmatically from external scripts or other applications. You can send prompts, generate images, and utilize speech synthesis through simple ARexx commands.

Note: MorphOS does not yet have a complete ARexx implementation. You must install the 68k version of ARexx on MorphOS to be able to use ARexx with AmigaGPT.

AmigaGPT also comes with a companion daemon app called AmigaGPTD. You may run this in the shell. The daemon will respond to the same ARexx commands as the main app so you do not need to launch the main AmigaGPT app.

Please note: AmigaGPT and AmigaGPTD listen on 2 differnt ARexx ports so adjust your scrips accordingly. AmigaGPT listens on @{b}AMIGAGPT@{ub} and AmigaGPTD listens on @{b}AMIGAGPTD@{ub}.

The following ARexx commands are available:

@{b}SENDMESSAGE@{ub}
Sends a message to the OpenAI API and returns the response.
SENDMESSAGE M=MODEL/K,S=SYSTEM/K,K=APIKEY/K,P=PROMPT/F

@node changelog "Changelog"
@{b}Changelog@{ub}

@{b}2.11.1 (2025-09-10)@{ub}

- Can now quit the app and daemon with CTRL-C in the shell
- AmigaGPTD now shows errors in requesters
- AmigaGPTD now launches with sufficient stack size
- Launching ARexx scripts from AmigaGPT now finds RX on earlier versions of AmigaOS 3

@{b}2.11.0 (2025-09-09)@{ub}

- New daemon app (AmigaGPTD). An app that has no GUI and can run in the background. If you have this running, there is no longer any need to have the main AmigaGPT app open if you want to use AmigaGPT's commands in ARexx. The daemon listens on the ARexx port named "AMIGAGPTD" so make sure your scripts try to connect to this new port first, and if it fails, attempt connecting to "AMIGAGPT" which is still the port used by the main app
- Chat message responses from ARexx now put escape sequences in the returned string instead of using control characters (e.g. \n instead of 0x0A) to make them easier to work with in ARexx scripts
- Automatically retry sending or receiving data if the request was made before the handshake had completed
- Greatly improved error reporting for connection errors. It now can show the user a much more detailed and useful error message if something goes wrong
- Added a 3 minute timeout for waiting for a response from the API so it will give up after 3 minutes with an error message instead of waiting forever and making AmigaGPT permanently stuck
- Stop the ARexx scripts that delete a temporary file from announcing the deletion to the user in the console
- Change the default program for the readme and the guide to both be MultiView
- Installer now installs the updated and new ARexx scripts if an older version of AmigaGPT is already installed

@{b}2.10.0 (2025-08-17)@{ub}

- Added menu option to print the conversation with the printer
- Now uses native MUI screen management (set screen in System menu in MUI settings)
- Added menu option to clear the MUI settings
- Added more entries to PATH in the ARexx execution environment so ARexx can run more commands just from their name
- Improve error handling in chat responses
- Restore backwards compatibility with AmigaOS 3.1
- Enter key to submit text now works in MUI 3.9 (not earlier)
- Fix crash opening the "About AmigaGPT" window on MUI 3.9

@{b}2.9.0 (2025-08-09)@{ub}

- Added gpt-5 chat models and make this the default chat model
- Fixed bad characters in About AmigaGPT window

@{b}2.8.0 (2025-08-02)@{ub}

- Add "Fixed width fonts" item in the "View" menu to toggle fixed width fonts for the chat input and chat output

@{b}2.7.0 (2025-07-27)@{ub}

- Stop the stack size warning appearing on MorphOS
- Running ARexx scripts now working in MorphOS (requires the 68k version of rexxsyslib.library installed)
- Fix bug where the conversation window will say "(null)" if the user clicks in the conversation list below all the entries
- Chat window scrolls to bottom when new text is received
- Can now send the message by pressing return (right shift + return will create a new line without sending) (MUI 5 only)
- The status bar now has a dark background to make the status more visible
- Fixed bug where your sent message does not get formatted correctly if it has more than 1 line
- While receiving a message, the chat window only shows the current message. This dramatically speeds up text rendering. Long conversations no longer become increasingly sluggish after every new message

@{b}2.6.0 (2025-05-06)@{ub}

- Added GPT Image 1 image model
- Added GPT-4.1 mini and GPT-4.1 nano chat models
- Retrieves image data directly from OpenAI instead of downloading from file server to speed up image retrieval
- Error messages can now be displayed in a requester if MUI is not finished initialising the app
- Now displays an informative error message if you are attempting to generate an image when you have insufficient credits in your OpenAI API account
- M68k version compiled with extra optimisations for faster code
- Fixed bug where AmigaGPT would get stuck after sending multiple chat messages
- Fixed the bsdsocket.library error that appears on MorphOS if the app is closed before it has finished loading
- Fix crash when toggling speech enabled in menu
- Fix crash when generating an image when OpenAI reports an error

@{b}2.5.0 (2025-04-25)@{ub}

- Added an ARexx menu to allow you to run your own scripts. ARexx is not yet implemented in MorphOS so you can try installing the 68k version of ARexx and see if that works.

- Status bar background colour adjusted to improve readability
- Latest OpenAI chat models added (gpt-4.1, o3, o4-mini)
