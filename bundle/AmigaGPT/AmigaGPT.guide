@node intro "Introduction"
@{b}Features@{ub}

AmigaGPT boasts a variety of exciting features:


- @{b}State-of-the-art language model@{ub}
AmigaGPT uses the GPT-4 architecture developed by OpenAI to generate coherent, context-aware responses to your input.

- @{b}Seamless integration with AmigaOS@{ub}
AmigaGPT takes full advantage of the latest AmigaOS 3.2 API to provide a smooth, native user experience without the need to have third party frameworks installed.

You can customise the look and feel of the application, including the ability to choose the fonts and a choice of opening in the Workbench screen or a custom screen.

- @{b}Speech capability@{ub}
AmigaGPT can use the Amiga's speech synthesis capability to read the generated text aloud with support for switching between the old Workbench 1.x v34 and the Workbench 2.0 v37 speech synthesisers.

@endnode

@node requirements "System Requirements"

@{b}System Requirements@{ub}

For smooth operation of AmigaGPT, your system needs to meet the following requirements:

@{" "}

- An OCS/ECS/AGA Amiga
- AmigaOS 3.9 suuported and AmigaOS 3.X (included in Amiga Forever) but 3.2 or higher recommended. AmigaOS 4.1 version also included.
- Motorola 68020 or higher CPU or PPC for AmigaOS 4
- Internet access using a TCP/IP stack such as Roadshow
- AmiSSL 5.9 or higher
- An OpenAI account with an active API key
- Optional: For speech on AmigaOS 3, any version of narrator.device
- Optional: For speech on AmigaOS 4, Flite Device

@endnode

@node installation "Installation"

@{b}Installation@{ub}

Follow the steps for successful installation:

@{" "}

- Install AmiSSL and a TCP/IP stack if not already done so
- Download the latest release of AmigaGPT
- Extract the amigagpt.lha archive to your desired location

@{b}Optional steps to enable speech functionality@{ub}

AmigaGPT supports reading the output aloud. How AmigaGPT does this depends on whether you are using AmigaOS 3 or 4.

@{b}AmigaOS 3@{ub}

Speech on AmigaOS 3 requires a file called `narrator.device` which cannot be included with AmigaGPT because it is still under copyright. Therefore, you must copy this file legally from your Workbench disks so that AmigaGPT will be able to synthesise speech. There are 2 versions of `narrator.device` supported, v34 and v37. 

v34 is the original version that came with Workbench 1.x.

v37 was an updated version included with Workbench 2.0.x. It has more features and sounds more natural, however it does sound quite different which is why AmigaGPT supports you installing both versions and your choice of version to be used can be selected in the Speech menu in the app.

Regardless of which version of 'narrator.device' you choose to install (or both), AmigaGPT requires that you install the free third party `translator.library; v43. This works with both versions of 'narrator.device'.

@{"Installing `translator.library` v43 " link tran43}
@{"Installing `narrator.device` v34 " link narrator34}
@{"Installing `narrator.device` v37 " link narrator37}

@{b}AmigaOS 4@{ub}

Speech on AmigaOS 4 is done with the help of Flite Device.

- Download Flite Device from http://aminet.net/package/mus/misc/flite_device
- Extract the archive and run the installer

@endnode

@node tran43 "Installing translator.library v43"

@{b}Installing `translator.library` v43@{ub}

Since `translator.library` v43 is not available as a standalone install, you will need to install v42 and then patch it to v43.

- Download http://aminet.net/util/libs/translator42.lha and extract the archive to any convenient location on your Amiga such as `RAM:`
- Navigate to that directory and double click the `Install` program
- Run the installer using all the default settings
- Download http://aminet.net/util/libs/Tran43pch.lha and once again extract it to a location of your choice
- Navigate to that directory and double click the `Install` program
- Run the installer using all the default settings
- Reboot your Amiga - It will not work until the system is restarted

@endnode

@node narrator34 "Installing `narrator.device` v34"

@{b}Installing `narrator.device` v34@{ub}

Insert your Workbench 1.x disk and copy `df0:devs/narrator.device` to `{AmigaGPTProgramDirectory}/devs/speech/34`

@endnode

@node narrator37 "Installing `narrator.device` v37"

@{b}Installing `narrator.device` v37@{ub}

Insert your Workbench 2.0.x (you cannot use 2.1 because the speech libraries were removed after version 2.0.4) disk and copy `df0:devs/narrator.device` to `{AmigaGPTProgramDirectory}/devs/speech/37`

@endnode

@node launching "Launching AmigaGPT"
@{b}Launching AmigaGPT@{ub}

- Launch the application by double-clicking the AmigaGPT icon
- You may also launch the app in the command line but before you do, run the command `STACK 20000` to give the program 20kb of stack since the default stack size for apps launched from the shell is 4kb and this is not enough for AmigaGPT and will cause random crashes due to stack overflow. This is not required when you launch the app by double clicking the icon since the stack size is saved in the icon.

@node usage "Usage"
@{b}Using AmigaGPT@{ub}

Click on a topic to learn about it:

@{"Entering your OpenAI API key " link apikey}
@{"Chatting with ChatGPT " link chatting}
@{"Generating images " link images}
@{"Conversation list " link conlist}
@{"Edit menu " link editmenu}
@{"Changing the font of the UI and chat " link font}

@endnode

@node screen "Screen select"
@{b}Selecting a screen to open AmigaGPT in@{ub}

When launched, AmigaGPT presents you with a choice of opening the app in a new screen or opening in Workbench. If you open in a new screen you have the ability to create a screen for the app to open in. AmigaGPT supports anything from 320x200 all the way up to 4k resolution if using a video card for RTG. Bear in mind text will appear very tiny in resolutions above 1080p so you may want to increase the font size settings from the View menu when the app opens.

There are 2 main modes of operation: Chat and Image Generation. You can switch between them via the tabs in the top left corner.

@endnode

@node apikey "Entering your OpenAI API key"
@{b}Entering your OpenAI API key@{ub}

When launching for the first time you will need to enter your OpenAI API key before you can start chatting. If you haven't already done so, create an OpenAI account and navigate to https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys to generate an API key for use with AmigaGPT.

@endnode

@node chatting "Chatting with ChatGPT"
@{b}Chatting with ChatGPT@{ub}

When the app has opened, you are presented with a text input box. You can type any prompt into this box and press "Send" or Shift + Enter to see ChatGPT's response. The generated text appears in the box above the input. Depending on if you have speech configured and enabled, you will also hear it spoken to you.

You can choose to have this text read aloud using the "Speech" menu option. You can also select which model for OpenAI to use in the "OpenAI" menu option.

@endnode

@node conlist "Conversation list"
@{b}Conversation list@{ub}

To the left of the chat box is a conversation list which you can use to go to another saved conversation. New conversations can be created with the "New chat" button and conversations can be removed with the "Delete chat" button. Your conversations will get saved and they will appear again the next time you open AmigaGPT.

@endnode

@node images "Generating images"
@{b}Generating Images@{ub}

To generate images, simply select your desired image generation model from the "OpenAI" menu then type your prompt in the text box then hit the "Create Image" button. When it has been downloaded to your Amiga, you are then able to open the image to your desired scale, or save a copy of the file to a new location on your Amiga. Do note however that AmigaGPT will automatially save all your generated images until you delete them. This is just in case you would like to create a copy elsewhere.

@endnode

@node editmenu "Edit menu"
@{b}Edit menu@{ub}

In the "Edit" menu, you'll find basic text editing commands like Cut, Copy, Paste and Clear.

@endnode

@node font "Changing the fonts"
@{b}Changing the fonts@{ub}

You may change the fonts of both the UI and the chat.


To change the font of either, go to the "View" menu.

@endnode

@node developing "Developing"
@{b}Developing@{ub}

Source code hosted at https://github.com/sacredbanana/AmigaGPT

You can either compile the code natively or with the Docker container.

@{b}Native@{ub}

@{i}Building the AmigaOS 3 app@{ui}

If you would like to build this project from source you will need Bebbo's @{b}amiga-gcc@{ub} toolchain here https://github.com/bebbo/amiga-gcc

Once this is installed, download the additional SDK's (AmiSSL, Translator, json-c) from https://github.com/sacredbanana/AmigaSDK-gcc and put them in your Amiga development environment installed in the above step.

@{i}Building the AmigaOS 4 app@{ui}

Get this toolchain set up https://github.com/sba1/adtools

Once installed, get the required other SDK's (AmiSSL, Translator, json-c) from https://github.com/sacredbanana/AmigaSDK-gcc and put these in your Amiga dev environment created in the above step.

@{b}Docker@{ub}

You may use an all-in-one Docker image that is able to compile both the AmigaOS 3 and AmigaOS 4 versions of the app.

Just install Docker on your machine and run the `build_os3.sh` or `build_os4.sh` scripts depending on which version of the app you want to build.
If you want to perform a clean build, you can set the environment variable `CLEAN=1` for example you can run `CLEAN=1 ./build_os3.sh`.

The build app will be saved to the `/out` directory.

@{b}GPT-4@{ub}


GPT-4 is currently in a limited beta and only accessible to those who have been granted access. Please join the waitlist (https://openai.com/waitlist/gpt-4) to get access.

GPT-4 is a large multimodal model (accepting text inputs and emitting text outputs today, with image inputs coming in the future) that can solve difficult problems with greater accuracy than any of our previous models, thanks to its broader general knowledge and advanced reasoning capabilities. For many basic tasks, the difference between GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 models is not significant. However, in more complex reasoning situations, GPT-4 is much more capable than any of our previous models.
