Type: util/misc
Version: 1.6.0
Architecture: m68k-amigaos >= 3.9; ppc-amigaos
Requires: AmigaOS 3.9+/68020+ util/libs/AmiSSL-5.9-OS3.lha
Replaces: util/misc/AmigaGPT.lha

AmigaGPT is a text and image generation program that runs on the classic
AmigaOS. Utilising the power of the OpenAI's GPT-3 and GPT-4 architectures,
this program brings state-of-the-art language modeling to your Amiga computer.

Features:
- Generates text based on input prompts
- Generates images based on input prompts
- UI customisation
- Full conversation history
- Text-to-speech

Requirements:
- OCS/ECS/AGA Amiga
- Motorola 68020 or higher CPU or PPC for AmigaOS 4
- AmigaOS 3.9 and AmigaOS 3.X (included in Amiga Forever) supported but
 3.2 or higher required for best experience. AmigaOS 4.1 version also included.
- AmiSSL 5.9 or higher (http://aminet.net/util/libs/AmiSSL-5.9-OS3.lha)
- Internet access using a TCP/IP stack such as Roadshow 
(http://roadshow.apc-tcp.de/index-en.php)
- An active OpenAI API key
- For speech on AmigaOS 3, any version of narrator.device
- For speech on AmigaOS 4, Flite Device
 (http://aminet.net/package/mus/misc/flite_device)
 - For OpenAI speech, AHI is required
 (http://aminet.net/package/driver/audio/ahiusr_4.18)

Installation:
1. Install AmiSSL and a TCP/IP stack if not already done so
2. Unpack the archive to a directory of your choice.
3. Run the Installer script included in the package.
4. Follow the prompts to complete the installation.

Optional steps to enable speech functionality:
AmigaGPT supports reading the output aloud. How AmigaGPT does this depends
on whether you are using AmigaOS 3 or 4.

AmigaOS 3:

Speech on AmigaOS 3 requires a file called `narrator.device` which cannot be
included with AmigaGPT because it is still under copyright. Therefore, you
must copy this file legally from yourWorkbench disks so that AmigaGPT will be
able to synthesise speech. There are 2 versions of `narrator.device`
supported, v34 and v37. 

v34 is the original version that came with Workbench 1.x. v37 was an updated
version included with Workbench 2.0.x. It has more features and sounds more
natural, however it does sound quite different which is why AmigaGPT supports
you installing both versions and your choice of version to be used can be
selected in the Speech menu in the app.

Regardless of which version of `narrator.device` you choose to install
(or both), AmigaGPT requires that you install the free third party
`translator.library` v43. This works with both versions of `narrator.device`.

Installing `translator.library` v43:
Since `translator.library` v43 is not available as a standalone install, you
will need to install v42 and then patch it to v43.
* Download http://aminet.net/util/libs/translator42.lha and extract the
archive to any convenient location on your Amiga such as `RAM:`
* Navigate to that directory and double click the `Install` program
* Run the installer using all the default settings
* Download http://aminet.net/util/libs/Tran43pch.lha and once again extract it
 to a location of your choice
* Navigate to that directory and double click the `Install` program
* Run the installer using all the default settings
* Reboot your Amiga - It will not work until the system is restarted

Installing `narrator.device` v34:
* Insert your Workbench 1.x disk and copy `df0:devs/narrator.device` to
 `{AmigaGPTProgramDirectory}/devs/speech/34`

Installing `narrator.device` v37
* Insert your Workbench 2.0.x (you cannot use 2.1 because the speech libraries
 were removed after version 2.0.4) disk and copy `df0:devs/narrator.device` to
`{AmigaGPTProgramDirectory}/devs/speech/37`

Installing AHI:
* If your OS does not come with AHI installed, you can get it from
 https://aminet.net/package/driver/audio/ahiusr_4.18

AmigaOS 4:

Speech on AmigaOS 4 is done with the help of Flite Device.

- Download Flite Device from http://aminet.net/package/mus/misc/flite_device
- Extract the archive and run the installer



Launching AmigaGPT:
* Launch the application by double-clicking the AmigaGPT icon
* You may also launch the app in the command line but before you do, run the
 command `STACK 20000` to give the program 20kb of stack since the default
 stack size for apps launched from the shell is 4kb and this is not enough for
 AmigaGPT and will cause random crashes due to stack overflow. This is not
 required when you launch the app by double clicking the icon since the stack
 size is saved in the icon.

Usage:
When launched, AmigaGPT presents you with a choice of opening the app in a new
screen or opening in Workbench. If you open in a new screen you have the
ability to create a screen for the app to open in. AmigaGPT supports anything
from 320x200 all the way up to 4k resolution if using a video card for RTG.
Bear in mind text will appear very tiny in resolutions above 1080p so you may
want to increase the font size settings from the View menu when the app opens.

When launching for the first time you will need to enter your OpenAI API key
before you can start chatting. If you haven't already done so, create an
OpenAI account and navigate to https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys to
generate an API key for use with AmigaGPT.

*Chat*

When the app has opened, you are presented with a text input box. You can type
any prompt into this box and press "Send" to see the GPT-4 model's response.
The generated text appears in the box above the input. You can choose to have
this text read aloud using the "Speech" menu option. You can also select which
model for OpenAI to use in the "OpenAI" menu option.

To the left of the chat box is a conversation list which you can use to go to
another saved conversation. New conversations can be created with the "New
chat" button and conversations can be removed with the "Delete chat" button.

There are 2 main modes of operation: Chat and Image Generation. You can switch
between them via the tabs in the top left corner.

*Image Generation*

To generate images, simply select your desired image generation model from the
"OpenAI" menu then type your prompt in the text box then hit the "Create Image"
button. When it has been downloaded to your Amiga, you are then able to open
the image to your desired scale, or save a copy of the file to a new location
on your Amiga. Do note however that AmigaGPT will automatially save all your
generated images until you delete them. This is just in case you would like to
create a copy elsewhere.

*General*

In the "Edit" menu, you'll find basic text editing commands like Cut, Copy,
Paste and Clear. The "View" menu allows you to change the font used in the
chat and the UI.

The "Project" menu includes an "About" option, which displays information
about the program.

Developing:
Source code hosted at https://github.com/sacredbanana/AmigaGPT
You can either compile the code natively or with the Docker container.

------
Native
------

*Building the AmigaOS 3 app*

If you would like to build this project from source you will need Bebbo's
amiga-gcc toolchain here https://github.com/bebbo/amiga-gcc

Once installed, get the required other SDK's  (AmiSSL, Translator, json-c)
from https://github.com/sacredbanana/AmigaSDK-gcc and put these in your Amiga
dev environment created in the above step.

*Building the AmigaOS 4 app*
Get this toolchain set up https://github.com/sba1/adtools

Once installed, get the required other SDK's  (AmiSSL, Translator, json-c)
from https://github.com/sacredbanana/AmigaSDK-gcc and put these in your Amiga
dev environment created in the above step.


------
Docker
------

You may use an all-in-one Docker image that is able to compile both the
AmigaOS 3 and AmigaOS 4 versions of the app.

Just install Docker on your machine and run the `build_os3.sh` or
`build_os4.sh` scripts depending on which version of the app you want to
 build. If you want to perform a clean build, you can set the environment
variable `CLEAN=1` for example you can run `CLEAN=1 ./build_os3.sh`.

The build app will be saved to the `/out` directory.
